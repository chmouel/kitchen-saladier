Install script
--------------

This install directory is for all the different installation ways for the
Saladier.

The `saladier-aio.sh` (aio == All in One) will install the saladier
when launched from a fresh fedora 21 with keystone etc.. This should be the
canonical script for the others methods (puppet, ansible, etc..)
